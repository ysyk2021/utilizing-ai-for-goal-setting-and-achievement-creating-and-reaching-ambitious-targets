Predictive analytics is a powerful tool for anticipating future developments and making informed decisions:

### **1. Forecasting Goal Progress**

* AI can analyze historical data and performance trends to predict whether you're on track to achieve your goals.

* It can provide forecasts and suggest corrective actions if necessary.

### **2. Identifying Potential Obstacles**

* AI can pinpoint potential obstacles or bottlenecks in your goal pursuit by analyzing data and external factors.

* Use this information to proactively address challenges before they impede your progress.

Decision Support Systems
